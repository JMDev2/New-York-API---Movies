      "summary_short": "Another marvel from Satoshi Kon, whose first two films, &quot;Perfect Blue&quot; and &quot;Millennium Actress,&quot; have already pushed Japanese feature-length animation toward greater realism and wilder fantasy. Loosely based on &quot;3 Godfathers,&quot; John Ford's maudlin 1948 western, this movie, a sweet fable of decency amid the down and out, also has echoes of Chaplin and Capra. Three homeless people — an embittered alcoholic, a middle-aged transvestite and a teenage runaway — find an abandoned baby on Christmas Eve. As they try to reunite the foundling with her parents, they revisit their own unhappy lives, and travel through a city rendered with unbelievable precision and tinted with undeniable love. The potentially sticky sentiments of the story are balanced by a crazily inventive narrative and by Mr. Kon's cool, obsessively detailed visual style. At the end, the skyscrapers of Tokyo wriggle and dance to a Japanese-language techno version of Beethoven's &quot;Ode to Joy,&quot; which pretty much sums up this indescribable, unforgettable movie. — A. O. Scott",
